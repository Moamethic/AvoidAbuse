# AvoidAbuse
Avoid receiving abuse messages and service take-downs from most DCs
This repo contains a lot of firewall rules (and a bash file in future) that will avoid your services from being blocked and/or recieving abuse messages.
This will be done by applying certain firewall rules which block specific IPs or services that often make your services abused.

PLEASE APPLY THESE RULES CAREFULLY, ANY MISTAKE CAN PUT YOUR CRITICAL SERVICES TO HAULT
